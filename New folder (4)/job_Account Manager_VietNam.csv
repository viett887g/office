We’re looking for the next generation of high-performing, multi-lingual, post-graduate talent to take our company forward. Hilti Outperformer is a global management development program like no other, with real responsibility from day one.
Who is Hilti?
Hilti is where innovation is improving productivity, safety and sustainability in the global construction industry, and beyond. Where strong customer relationships are creating solutions that build a better future. Where there is pride and a sense of belonging across our 120 locations, carrying right into our lives and homes. Where people are exploring possibilities, leveraging their potential, owning their personal development and growing lasting careers..
What does the role involve?
Hilti Outperformer is a two-year program, where you’ll quickly be involved in a range of international projects, with lots of exposure to senior management. It’s fast paced and challenging, but we’ll closely coach and mentor you. The program is split into four main stages of work:

12 months as an account manager or field engineer in the country where you apply.
3 months on an operational project in national headquarters. It could be logistics, HR, finance, marketing or engineering.
6 months on a strategic project in the regional headquarters (Singapore)
3 months on a strategic project outside the region. If you’ve come from a mature market, you’ll work in an emerging market, and vice versa.
80% of our management positions are filled with internal candidates. It’s testament to how much we value, develop and look after our people.
What do we offer?
Show us what you can do and, in return, we promise you the experience of a lifetime, the opportunity to work internationally, and a fast-track career in global senior management. You’ll also take part in some fascinating courses and events:

Leadership development program – a comprehensive learning journey with IMD business school in Lausanne, Switzerland, with a qualification from IMD.
Business management training – individual training at Hilti. A focus on behavioral profiles, personal strengths, leadership styles and communication skills.
Global summit – 4-5 days at our global headquarters in Liechtenstein. A look at the way global business units function, plus soft skills like situational leadership and international teamwork.
Social project – 7-8 days ‘building a better future’. A hands-on and hugely impactful community project, like our recent house building for displaced refugees in Bosnia.

At Axon, we're on a mission to Protect Life. We're explorers, pursuing society's most critical safety and justice issues with our ecosystem of devices and cloud software. Like our products, we work better together. We connect with candor and care, seeking out diverse perspectives from our customers, communities and each other.

Life at Axon is fast-paced, challenging and meaningful. Here, you'll take ownership and drive real change. Constantly grow as you work hard for a mission that matters at a company where you matter.
Your Impact
Our Digital Evidence Management System (DEMS) team is solving difficult cloud and local storage challenges. Axon manages massive amounts of digital files – tens of petabytes from thousands of first responders worldwide. The DEMS team works on improving workflows for the ingestion, playback, management & access control, searching, and sharing of case related files, increasing efficiency within the justice system. If you're looking for ownership and autonomy while collaborating across product teams, this role is for you.

Our Team

We believe that happy teams take good care of their customers, so we foster a friendly, open, introspective team culture that encourages everyone to speak their mind and deliberately avoid red tape, unnecessary rituals, politics, and jerks. We focus on productivity, and try to avoid having senseless meetings or processes, while we emphasize planning to keep our work-life balance healthy and sustainable.

We can only succeed if we deeply understand our customers and get to know them personally. We spend time with law enforcement officers to learn about their needs, watch their experience and see the real impact of our work. Your first ride-along with a patrol officer will forever change your perception of first responders and their role in society.
What You'll Do
Location: Ho Chi Minh City or Remote
Reports to: Director of Product Design, Axon Evidence
Direct Reports: 2-3 product designers initially

Manage a team of 2-3 product designers and own parts of the cases & sharing experience across the DEMS organization and collaborate on cross product strategy for Axon-wide cases & sharing workflows.
You'll have ownership of the full design process, from partnering with product managers on initial research and discovery through concepting, detailed design, testing, and ongoing design iteration.
Collaborate with product managers and researchers in field research with domestic and international law enforcement agencies and help transform that research into practical, scalable solutions using a variety of research methods: observational, interviews, participatory, usability testing, competitive analysis, etc.
Produce artifacts that define and communicate your solutions. It will be up to you, but we generally use a combination of journey maps, architecture diagrams, wireframes, final designs, interaction diagrams, and prototypes.
Communicate your solutions within the team and across the organization to gain buy-in and support through building alignment and articulating your vision through strong storytelling and presentations skills. You will present product and feature design proposals up to the executive level.
Collaborate with feature and product teams to think in terms of broad platform and systems strategy to ensure consistent user experiences for our customers across all products.
Work closely with business, product and engineering stakeholders.
Research design trends, customer behavior, competition and current technologies to inform the work you are doing.
Contribute to defining global design patterns, vision, and processes for Axon products.
Be an ambassador, mentor other designers and a champion for the design culture at Axon.
What You Bring
6+ years of product design experience with 2+ years of leading major product design initiatives in medium to high complexity and 2+ years of people management of at least 2 direct reports.
