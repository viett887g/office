Support the customer operations, marketing team in getting insights from the data, such as performance, accuracy metrics, impact of real-time events, etc. as required.
Maintain, own internal and customer dashboards based on the trial/account requirements (e.g. prediction accuracy, timeliness, coverage, explainability).

Bachelor's or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Information Technology, or a related field.

OLIVER provides clients with dedicated agencies. We do this because we believe the traditional agency model is not fit for the speed of modern marketing.

The traditional agency outside-in model means that huge quantities of time are wasted in the back and forth and linear processes between agencies and clients. OLIVER agencies come to the client, live inside their office and solve their problems collaboratively.
OLIVER agencies are strategic and creative, whilst being agile and adaptive. They cover the full range of integrated marketing, but at the speed that businesses now demand. We allow our clients to work in real time. Creating better work, at pace.

OUR VALUES AND HOW TO LIVE THEM:
Ambition – you look for opportunities to deliver greater value to those around you.
Imagination – you identify a range of solutions to problems.
Inclusion – to be actively pro-inclusive and anti-racist across our community, clients and creations.
Inspiration – you lead by example and encourage others to do the same.
Learning – you have excellent listening skills that helps you to learn from our clients and those around you.
Results – you accept responsibility for your actions.
We've set ambitious, market-leading environmental and social goals around sustainability at OLIVER. We have committed to be net zero by 2030 and take far reaching action on DE&I in the sector. We expect everyone to contribute to our mission, embedding sustainability into every department and through every stage of the project lifecycle.

Problem Solving Centric
Job description
The position
We’re the team behind projects like BI tool , database diagram tool , and open-source project . We’re looking for another front-end engineer to help us build more awesome tools for data teams and developers.
This is a full-time position based in Ho Chi Minh City with flexible, hybrid WFH/WFO setup.
Our application’s architecture
To get a taste of how working with us is like, here are some insights into how our application has been built so far.
The Holistics app works by allowing data analysts to connect to their data warehouses and develop reusable “data models”. This allows non-technical users to use a friendly drag-and-drop interface to explore the data and build dashboards, without the need to bother their technical colleagues.
On the frontend side, Vue.js 3.0 with TypeScript is our framework of choice for front-end development. To deal with displaying huge amount of data, we build sophisticated, custom Vue components that lazily render the data. Since many complex computation are done on the front-end, we also use Web workers to decouple those computation from the main rendering thread. This enables smoother user experience while also decoupling computation from rendering logic.
Most of our “as-code” features operate in dual modes: code-mode and UI-mode. The code is for technical-savvy users, while the UI mode is for those who prefer a more intuitive start. To support these features, we have developed our own compiler and a web-based editor, similar to a lightweight version of VSCode, both of which are optimized for performance in the browser environment.
On the backend side, Holistics is built using Ruby on Rails as the main web framework. Unlike standard Rails project structure, we modularize the code base into local gems and to improve maintainability and extensibility, following . This also follows the pattern of “ with the gems being mostly functional/stateless code and engines handle the imperative/stateful part of the app.
By using to add static typing on top of Ruby, we ensure that most of our Ruby code has annotated type signature. This not only reduces a whole swath of common bugs that plague Ruby codebases but also significantly improves developer productivity through IDE/editor integrations.
We use PostgreSQL for our main production database due to its reliability and rich feature-set. We have built a , which are then executed using Sidekiq on top of Redis.
What you’ll work on here
Here are some interesting engineering projects that have been going on inside Holistics
Build a web-based IDE for data analysts to explore and develop analytics logic
Build front-end components that can render hundreds of thousand of data points
Build custom, interactive visualization components on top of open source technology
Create a as part of a semantic layer to represent analytics logic
Build a text-based database for analytics metadata on top of Git
Create a that compiles to SQL
Design and build a natural language interface for business users to explore data and view dashboards
The way we work
We follow Spotify squad model. Our team is split into 4 squads, each (5-7 members) consisting of engineers, product managers & designers working closely together.
How we work on a new feature:
Product & Design Team spends time research the problem, talk to customers and prepare Product Discovery Doc (PDD) and Product Requirement Doc (PRD).
Engineering Team then performs a Technical Research. When we have a fairly good picture of the complexity and impact, we’ll start with the implementation.
We do not compromise product and code quality for artificial deadline. We refactor and think about code optimization regularly. We understand the good and bad of technical debt and use them to our advantage.
We employ “pair programming” practices regularly where two team members work on a task together in one workstation. This brings a great deal of benefits, among which are faster knowledge transfer, reduced bus factor, better team cohesion and improved code quality.
We have a strong writing culture: Almost everything is communicated through written documents. Just as our developers write reusable codes, we write .
We maintain a problem-solving culture. Everyone is strongly encouraged to have rigorous understanding of a problem, separating as well as using to find the most important dimensions of a problem. Solutions are deliberated over with trade-offs explicitly listed in discussion documentation. Watch that our cofounder gave (in Vietnamese)
We avoid being a . We’re aware more features do not equal better product.
We let team members rotate every 3-6 months. This allows them to try new things and learn different aspects of the business.
Our culture stimulates continuous learning:
We have a where team members present topics they are interested in.
Engineering Team organizes as well as monthly technical workshops.
Product Team has regular AMA events with external product experts
Your skills and experience
What we look for in you
Here’s our idea of a good team member fit:
You should have a profound interest in the front-end domain. You deeply care about the user experience and building high-performance front-end components.
You should have a strong foundation in Computer Science with good problem-solving ability.
Experience with our technology stack not required: While it’s a bonus, it’s not a requirement for you to be familiar with our current technical stack. We expect you to be able to pick up these quickly on the job.
You should be someone with a continuous learning & growth mindset. You find yourself excited to learn something new as part of the work every week.
Communications: Given we have a strong writing culture, you should be comfortable with communicating your ideas in English written forms.
Genuine interest in the space: We’d love to work with people who are genuinely interested in the product and the space we’re in, someone who cares about the end-product beyond just writing the code that makes it work.
Interview Process
Round 1: Technical interview with the Engineering team (understand your skills and experiences). (Showcase your past front-end projects is highly welcome. We would love to know your approaches to solving UX challenges/performance optimization. Additionally, sharing your codes would be greatly appreciated, as it provides us with a deeper insight into your problem-solving skills and technical prowess.)‍
Round 2: Either System Design interview or takehome assignment (offline - deadline 3 days, will be sent after Round 1)
Round 3: Culture & Behavior Interview

Responsibilities:

What you will do

You will be working collaboratively to use data to positively inform and influence the business decisions at PropertyGuru.
You will use the data to create compelling narratives to help drive action. For example, why do certain property listings get significantly higher page views than their peers? What actions do consumers/users browsing on the property take before they zero in on the right property? These are some of the many questions that get asked of our data analyst team in PropertyGuru. These questions drive our product development decisions and inform and recommend action items for the marketing, advertising campaigns and product development.
You will also be taking part to evaluate and report the key business metrics for the businesses. You will spend time understanding the drivers of the metrics to help the stakeholders understand the potential reasons and hypotheses for the changes. Some of these are related to the A/B experiments that are performed on the users and products as part of their development.
Since most of these analyses are driving important decisions, you will need to ensure that these analyses are repeatable and accessible to all with appropriate documentation.

Minimum 5 years of industry experience in working with large-scale datasets.
Analytical and structured thinking (must have).
Communication skills: Can explain the data from business perspective, communicate clearly and effectively to cross-functional business partners of varying technical levels. Good data story telling skill and be able to handle stakeholders’ expectations.
Result-oriented and get things done mindset. “We push beyond good” and “We own it and deliver it” are our working culture.
Have experience with deep dive and advance analytics, for example forecasting model, customers segmentation, customer behaviors analysis..
The data analyst must be willing to work with unclean data. We have a lot of new features per quarter, which means DA must be prepared to work with new, unprocessed data.
Knowledge of SQL is a must. You will need to write custom queries to pull data from BigQuery to support your analyses and hypothesis.
Build clear and simple dashboards and presentations. We currently use Looker Studio and Looker for reporting and visualizations.
English language fluency is a plus, some of your stakeholders are foreigners and will require you to document your works and present in English.
Have a good business mindset, love to solve business questions and eager to make impact.
Love innovations and apply new technology to “create what’s next”.

Experience working with Google Analytics, Google tag manager is a plus.
Experience in Python, Airflow, Gitlab is a plus. This is not a must-have requirement, but good to have if you aspire to grow as a data analyst.

Top 3 reasons to join us
People-first
Teamwork over one's work
Problem Solving Centric
Job description
We’re the team behind projects like BI tool Holistics [1], database diagram tool dbdiagram.io [2], and open-source project dbml.org [3]. We’re looking for another software engineer to help us build more awesome tools for data teams and developers.
This is a full-time position based in Ho Chi Minh City with flexible, hybrid WFH/WFO setup.
Our application’s architecture
To get a taste of how working with us is like, here are some insights into how our application has been built so far.
The Holistics app works by allowing data analysts to connect to their data warehouses and develop reusable “data models”. This allows non-technical users to use a friendly drag-and-drop interface to explore the data and build dashboards, without the need to bother their technical colleagues.
On the backend side, Holistics is built using Ruby on Rails as the main web framework. Unlike standard Rails project structure, we modularize the code base into local gems and engines [4] to improve maintainability and extensibility, following modular monolith pattern [5]. This also follows the pattern of “Functional core, imperative shell"" [6] with the gems being mostly functional/stateless code and engines handling the imperative/stateful part of the app.
By using Sorbet [7] to add static typing on top of Ruby, we ensure that most of our Ruby code has annotated type signature. This not only reduces a whole swath of common bugs that plagues Ruby codebases but also significantly improves developer productivity through IDE/editor integrations.
We use PostgreSQL for our main production database due to its reliability and rich feature-set. We have built a custom job queue system on top of Postgres [8], which are then executed using Sidekiq on top of Redis.
Vue.js 3.0 with TypeScript is our framework of choice for front-end development. To deal with displaying huge amounts of data, we build sophisticated, custom Vue components that lazily render the data. Since many complex computations are done on the front-end, we also use Web workers to decouple those computations from the main rendering thread. This enables a smoother user experience while also decoupling computation from rendering logic.

What you’ll work on here
Here are some interesting engineering projects that have been going on inside Holistics
Create a new query language that compiles to SQL
Build front-end component that can render hundreds of thousands of data points
Build custom, interactive visualization components on top of open source technology
Create a domain specific language as part of a semantic layer to represent analytics logic
Build a text-based database for analytics metadata on top of Git
Build a web-based IDE for data analysts to explore and develop analytics logic
Design and build a natural language interface for business users to explore data and view dashboards
‍
The way we work
We follow Spotify squad model. Our team is split into 4 squads, each (5-7 members) consisting of engineers, product managers & designers working closely together.
How we work on a new feature:
Product & Design Team spends time researching the problem, talking to customers and prepare Product Discovery Doc (PDD) and Product Requirement Doc (PRD).
Engineering Team then performs a Technical Research. When we have a fairly good picture of the complexity and impact, we’ll start with the implementation.
We avoid being a feature factory [9]. We’re aware more features do not equal better product.
We do not compromise product and code quality for artificial deadlines. We refactor and think about code optimization regularly. We understand the good and bad of technical debt and use them to our advantage.
We employ “pair programming” practices regularly where two team members work on a task together in one workstation. This brings a great deal of benefits, among which are faster knowledge transfer, reduced bus factor, better team cohesion, and improved code quality.
We have a strong writing culture: Almost everything is communicated through written documents. Just as our developers write reusable codes, we write evergreen notes [10].
We maintain a problem-solving culture. Everyone is strongly encouraged to have rigorous understanding of a problem, separating Problem Space vs Solution Space [11] as well as using Eigenquestions [12] to find the most important dimensions of a problem. Solutions are deliberated over with trade-offs explicitly listed in discussion documentation. Watch this talk about problem-solving for engineers [13] that our cofounder gave (in Vietnamese)

Our culture stimulates continuous learning:
We let team members rotate every 3-6 months. This allows them to try new things and learn different aspects of the business.
Our culture stimulates continuous learning:
We have a weekly TED talk program [14] where team members present topics they are interested in.
Engineering Team organizes weekly technical talks [15] as well as monthly technical workshops.
Product Team has regular AMA events with external product experts
Your skills and experience
What we look for in you
Here’s our idea of a good team member fit:
You should have a strong foundation in Computer Science with good problem-solving ability.
Experience with our technology stack not required: While it’s a bonus, it’s not a requirement for you to be familiar with our current technical stack. We expect you to be able to pick up these quickly on the job.
You should be someone with a continuous learning & growth mindset. You find yourself excited to learn something new as part of the work every week.
Communications: Given we have a strong writing culture, you should be comfortable with communicating your ideas in English written forms.
Genuine interest in the space: We’d love to work with people who are genuinely interested in the product and the space we’re in, someone who cares about the end-product beyond just writing the code that makes it work.

Interview Process
Round 1: Technical interview with the Engineering team (understand your skills and experiences)
Round 2: Either System Design interview or takehome assignment (offline - deadline 3 days, will be sent after Round 2)
Round 3: Culture & Behavior Interview
