HRS PAY is a “tech fin” in that we provide the technology that powers the payment workflow as well as delivers the highest level of available payment data to enable our customers to make intelligent decisions around their program spending. Only HRS PAY offers this powerful combination of automation, data optimization, and payment on-the-go technology all in one platform.

Ví dụ bài toán: CEO hỏi: “Hành vi học của khách hàng tháng vừa rồi có ổn không?”
– Nhanh gọn lẹ để có data mong muốn.
Ví dụ bài toán: COO hỏi: “Bao giờ có được dữ liệu về kết quả của tính năng mới vừa lên? Thời gian đó đã tối ưu nhất chưa, có nhanh hơn được nữa không?”
– Visualize data.
Ví dụ bài toán: PM hỏi: “Hành trình khách hàng từ lúc cài app tới lúc quyết định mua hàng thế nào?”
– Khai phá dữ liệu. Dữ liệu có nhiều insights, có thể chúng mình chưa tận dụng được hết, rất cần người “đào cùng”.

CALL FOR CONSULTANCY SERVICE
A national consultant to conduct an analysis of cost-effectiveness
of HIV viral load testing services
I. Background:
The global LHSS project helps low- and middle-income countries transition to sustainable, self-funded health finance systems that support high-performing overall health systems. The LHSS activity in Vietnam will work with the Government of Vietnam (GVN) to advance greater local ownership of HIV and TB prevention and control. Led by Abt Associates, the four-year activity will support Vietnam in increasing its domestic financing for HIV and TB services in the context of declining donor funding, using government resources more efficiently, and assuming local ownership of HIV and TB prevention and control activities. Specific objectives are: (1) Support the GVN to strengthen its public financial management systems for public sector health and find greater efficiencies in social health insurance (SHI), (2) Increase and improve the efficiency of domestic financing of HIV prevention and treatment services; (3) Strengthen the capacity of Vietnam's supply chain management system; and (4) Transition of TB services into SHI.
Viral load tests for HIV are currently provided at health facilities where PLHIV receive ARV treatment or outsourced to certified laboratories either in the same localities or outside the provinces/cities which requires the transportation of specimens. Per the recent USAID visits to USAID’s supported provinces, it was noticed that most provinces wanted to provide HIV viral load tests at laboratories inside the provinces. In order to help optimize the provincial VL testing network, USAID requested LHSS to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of VL tests performed on the testing machines placed at provincial CDCs, provincial hospitals, and health facilities. This analysis would help inform the provincial’s decision of either maintaining the current VL test provision network or making further investments in expanding it. The analysis will target 14 laboratories having VL testing machines in five USAID-supported provinces namely Ho Chi Minh City, Dong Nai, Tay Ninh, Tien Giang, and Quang Ninh.
II. Tasks and Deliverables:
Tasks:
The consultant's role will encompass collaborative engagement with the USAID/EpiC project, provincial, CDCs, and hospitals situated within the provinces receiving support from USAID. His/her primary task will be to gather pertinent data and information, which will be subsequently employed to execute a comprehensive analysis focusing on assessing the cost-effectiveness of the HIV viral load tests performed on the testing machines placed in the provinces. This analysis will inform and guide the formulation of recommendations pertaining to further investment of testing machines to optimize the HIV viral load testing network within the provinces.
Deliverables:
A methodology paper describing how the analysis will be conducted.
A draft analysis report for comments by LHSS, USAID, and implementing partners.
Presentations with summarized results if requested by LHSS for
Final analysis report with recommendations on the expansion of the VL testing network.
Consultant monthly reports on the progress of task implementation.
A final consultancy report.
Consultant shall submit monthly reports that describe the work done in the month, key findings, and attachment of supporting documents if any. The consultant shall submit the final report at the end of the contract.
III. Location and timing:
The expert's assignment is in Hanoi with travelling to the five mentioned provinces.
The assignment should take place from December 2023 through May 2024 with a total of up to 50 working days.
IV. Requirements:
Graduate degree in health economics, health financing, public finance management, or relevant disciplines.
Proven experience in designing and conducting cost-effectiveness analyses for health services.
Good understanding of the laboratory system in the health sector and policies regulating laboratory services.
Analytical and forecasting skills: Proficient in analyzing economic and financial data, providing forecasts, and proposing suitable investment strategies.
Ability to work effectively with USAID, CDCs, provincial hospitals, and other government agencies.
Language requirement: Vietnamese. The ability to speak English would be an advantage.
V. Management of the assignment
The consultant will report to the Technical Director at LHSS Vietnam. He/She will work closely with the USAID/EpiC project, provincial, CDCs, and hospitals situated within the provinces receiving support from USAID and others as needed.

CONTEXT
World Vision is a Christian relief, development and advocacy organization working to improve the quality of life of people, especially children who are marginalized and living in poverty. World Vision helps all who are in need, regardless of their religion, race, ethnicity or gender. As a child-focused organization, WV’s work focuses on children, ensuring they are protected and their basic needs are met. World Vision Vietnam (WVV) has been funded from 13 support countries in Europe, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Funding of WVV consists of sponsorship program funding (70%) and Private Non-Sponsorship (PNS)/grants (30%). WVV employs about 430 staff, of which 93% are Vietnamese nationals.
WVV is operating in 14 provinces. WVV’s Area Program (AP) usually focuses within one administrative district of a province which populated by ethnic minority people with high rates of poverty. A uniqueness of WVV’s Development Program Approach (DPA) is that AP team members are based at district level where the AP is located, which enables them to work closely with government partners and communities on a daily basis. Beside the APs, WVV is also implementing different Special and Grant Projects to meet the specific needs of vulnerable children in both AP and non-AP areas.
In alignment with three ministry strategic objectives, WVV has developed three Technical Approaches (TA) and designed three Technical Programs (TPs): Child Protection, Nutrition and Health and Livelihoods. Technical Programmes are national or sub-regional level programmes implemented by World Vision in multiple geographic locations within a country. They employ evidence-based practices and models previously identified, defined and prioritised through a strategic process and documented in a Technical Approach (TA). TP are designed to ensure National Offices (NOs) achieve World Vision’s mission, which includes the highest impact for the well-being of children, in accordance with relevant TA and NO Strategic Objectives.

PMI is a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, smoke-free products and associated electronic devices and accessories, and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the U.S. PMI is building a future on a new category of smoke-free products that, while addictive and not risk free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke. Through world-class multidisciplinary capabilities in product development and scientific substantiation, as well as state-of-the-art R&D facilities, PMI aims to ensure that its smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. PMI’s smoke-free IQOS product portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products. As of October 2019, PMI estimates that approximately 12.4 million adult smokers around the world have already stopped smoking and switched to PMI’s heated tobacco product, available for sale in 51 markets in key cities or nationwide (including the UK, Germany, Russia, Italy, Japan, Korea..., most recently the US, to name a few) under the IQOS brand.

Top 3 reasons to join us
People-first
Teamwork over one's work
Problem Solving Centric
Job description
The position
We’re the team behind projects like BI tool , database diagram tool , and open-source project . We’re looking for another front-end engineer to help us build more awesome tools for data teams and developers.
This is a full-time position based in Ho Chi Minh City with flexible, hybrid WFH/WFO setup.
Our application’s architecture
To get a taste of how working with us is like, here are some insights into how our application has been built so far.
The Holistics app works by allowing data analysts to connect to their data warehouses and develop reusable “data models”. This allows non-technical users to use a friendly drag-and-drop interface to explore the data and build dashboards, without the need to bother their technical colleagues.
On the frontend side, Vue.js 3.0 with TypeScript is our framework of choice for front-end development. To deal with displaying huge amount of data, we build sophisticated, custom Vue components that lazily render the data. Since many complex computation are done on the front-end, we also use Web workers to decouple those computation from the main rendering thread. This enables smoother user experience while also decoupling computation from rendering logic.
Most of our “as-code” features operate in dual modes: code-mode and UI-mode. The code is for technical-savvy users, while the UI mode is for those who prefer a more intuitive start. To support these features, we have developed our own compiler and a web-based editor, similar to a lightweight version of VSCode, both of which are optimized for performance in the browser environment.
On the backend side, Holistics is built using Ruby on Rails as the main web framework. Unlike standard Rails project structure, we modularize the code base into local gems and to improve maintainability and extensibility, following . This also follows the pattern of “ with the gems being mostly functional/stateless code and engines handle the imperative/stateful part of the app.
By using to add static typing on top of Ruby, we ensure that most of our Ruby code has annotated type signature. This not only reduces a whole swath of common bugs that plague Ruby codebases but also significantly improves developer productivity through IDE/editor integrations.
We use PostgreSQL for our main production database due to its reliability and rich feature-set. We have built a , which are then executed using Sidekiq on top of Redis.
What you’ll work on here
Here are some interesting engineering projects that have been going on inside Holistics
Build a web-based IDE for data analysts to explore and develop analytics logic
Build front-end components that can render hundreds of thousand of data points
Build custom, interactive visualization components on top of open source technology
Create a as part of a semantic layer to represent analytics logic
Build a text-based database for analytics metadata on top of Git
Create a that compiles to SQL
Design and build a natural language interface for business users to explore data and view dashboards
The way we work
We follow Spotify squad model. Our team is split into 4 squads, each (5-7 members) consisting of engineers, product managers & designers working closely together.
How we work on a new feature:
Product & Design Team spends time research the problem, talk to customers and prepare Product Discovery Doc (PDD) and Product Requirement Doc (PRD).
Engineering Team then performs a Technical Research. When we have a fairly good picture of the complexity and impact, we’ll start with the implementation.
We do not compromise product and code quality for artificial deadline. We refactor and think about code optimization regularly. We understand the good and bad of technical debt and use them to our advantage.
We employ “pair programming” practices regularly where two team members work on a task together in one workstation. This brings a great deal of benefits, among which are faster knowledge transfer, reduced bus factor, better team cohesion and improved code quality.
We have a strong writing culture: Almost everything is communicated through written documents. Just as our developers write reusable codes, we write .
We maintain a problem-solving culture. Everyone is strongly encouraged to have rigorous understanding of a problem, separating as well as using to find the most important dimensions of a problem. Solutions are deliberated over with trade-offs explicitly listed in discussion documentation. Watch that our cofounder gave (in Vietnamese)
We avoid being a . We’re aware more features do not equal better product.
We let team members rotate every 3-6 months. This allows them to try new things and learn different aspects of the business.
Our culture stimulates continuous learning:
We have a where team members present topics they are interested in.
Engineering Team organizes as well as monthly technical workshops.
Product Team has regular AMA events with external product experts
Your skills and experience
What we look for in you
Here’s our idea of a good team member fit:
You should have a profound interest in the front-end domain. You deeply care about the user experience and building high-performance front-end components.
You should have a strong foundation in Computer Science with good problem-solving ability.
Experience with our technology stack not required: While it’s a bonus, it’s not a requirement for you to be familiar with our current technical stack. We expect you to be able to pick up these quickly on the job.
You should be someone with a continuous learning & growth mindset. You find yourself excited to learn something new as part of the work every week.
Communications: Given we have a strong writing culture, you should be comfortable with communicating your ideas in English written forms.
Genuine interest in the space: We’d love to work with people who are genuinely interested in the product and the space we’re in, someone who cares about the end-product beyond just writing the code that makes it work.
Interview Process
Round 1: Technical interview with the Engineering team (understand your skills and experiences). (Showcase your past front-end projects is highly welcome. We would love to know your approaches to solving UX challenges/performance optimization. Additionally, sharing your codes would be greatly appreciated, as it provides us with a deeper insight into your problem-solving skills and technical prowess.)‍
Round 2: Either System Design interview or takehome assignment (offline - deadline 3 days, will be sent after Round 1)
Round 3: Culture & Behavior Interview
