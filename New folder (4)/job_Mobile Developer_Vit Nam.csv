Job description
As a Mobile Software Engineer, your main job is to make our Android apps better. We use Kotlin to build these apps, and you'll partake in planning, designing, and adding new features to make our users and tenant customers happy.
You're not new to this - you've been doing iOS and Android app development for a long time and are familiar with native targeting and development on each. You're also great with different frameworks like React Native, Flutter, and Kotlin/Native. This is important because we're giving you a big challenge. You'll need to switch between these platforms and frameworks quickly to make something new called headless SDKs. These SDKs will help our tenant-class customers add our services to their own mobile and web apps.
You're a key part of our team, and your work directly affects how happy our carrier-class customers are with us. We also care a lot about our end-users, so we want to make sure their experience with our apps is smooth and enjoyable. You have the power to speak up if you think a design will make things hard for
our users.
You'll be working closely with the Mobile Software Engineer Team Lead and other developers, including those who work on the backend and frontend. Sometimes, you'll team up with the Scrum Master and Head of QA. You might also talk with the Head of Design and Planning. Just so you know, you won't be managing a team in this role.

Make A Real Difference at PropertyGuru.
Real Aspirations. Real People. Real impact.

PropertyGuru is Southeast Asia’s leading PropTech company, and the preferred destination for over 41 million property seekers to connect with more than 63,000 agents monthly to find their dream home. PropertyGuru empowers property seekers with more than 3.2 million real estate listings, in-depth insights, and solutions that enable them to make confident property decisions across Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam.
PropertyGuru.com.sg was launched in Singapore in 2007 and since then PropertyGuru Group has made the property journey a transparent one for property seekers in Southeast Asia. In the last 15 years, PropertyGuru has grown into a high-growth PropTech company with a robust portfolio of leading property marketplaces across its core markets; award-winning mobile apps; mortgage marketplace, PropertyGuru Finance; and a host of enterprise solutions now under PropertyGuru For Business, including a high-quality developer sales enablement platform, FastKey, DataSense, ValueNet, Awards, events and publications across Asia.

Responsibilities:

What you will do

You will be working collaboratively to use data to positively inform and influence the business decisions at PropertyGuru.
You will use the data to create compelling narratives to help drive action. For example, why do certain property listings get significantly higher page views than their peers? What actions do consumers/users browsing on the property take before they zero in on the right property? These are some of the many questions that get asked of our data analyst team in PropertyGuru. These questions drive our product development decisions and inform and recommend action items for the marketing, advertising campaigns and product development.
You will also be taking part to evaluate and report the key business metrics for the businesses. You will spend time understanding the drivers of the metrics to help the stakeholders understand the potential reasons and hypotheses for the changes. Some of these are related to the A/B experiments that are performed on the users and products as part of their development.
Since most of these analyses are driving important decisions, you will need to ensure that these analyses are repeatable and accessible to all with appropriate documentation.

Requirements:

Minimum 5 years of industry experience in working with large-scale datasets.
Analytical and structured thinking (must have).
Communication skills: Can explain the data from business perspective, communicate clearly and effectively to cross-functional business partners of varying technical levels. Good data story telling skill and be able to handle stakeholders’ expectations.
Result-oriented and get things done mindset. “We push beyond good” and “We own it and deliver it” are our working culture.
Have experience with deep dive and advance analytics, for example forecasting model, customers segmentation, customer behaviors analysis..
The data analyst must be willing to work with unclean data. We have a lot of new features per quarter, which means DA must be prepared to work with new, unprocessed data.
Knowledge of SQL is a must. You will need to write custom queries to pull data from BigQuery to support your analyses and hypothesis.
Build clear and simple dashboards and presentations. We currently use Looker Studio and Looker for reporting and visualizations.
English language fluency is a plus, some of your stakeholders are foreigners and will require you to document your works and present in English.
Have a good business mindset, love to solve business questions and eager to make impact.
Love innovations and apply new technology to “create what’s next”.

Good to have

Experience working with Google Analytics, Google tag manager is a plus.
Experience in Python, Airflow, Gitlab is a plus. This is not a must-have requirement, but good to have if you aspire to grow as a data analyst.
Familiar with Jira and using Kanban to manage task.
Experience working with Technology product/platform

PropertyGuru Group is an equal opportunity employer committed to fostering an inclusive, innovative an learning environment with the best employees. Therefore, we provide employment opportunities without regard to gender, identity, race, religion, nationality, age, marital status, disability, or any other protected status, per applicable law.
