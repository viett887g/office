MEL Manager

Background
Improving Private Sector Competitiveness (IPSC) is a U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) technical assistance project, and the Agency for Enterprise Development (AED) under the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) is the project owner. The project is implemented by Deloitte Consulting LLP (“Deloitte”) and runs from 2020 to 2025.
The purpose of the USAID IPSC Activity is to remove constraints and build the competitiveness of small and growing businesses (SGBs) in Vietnam, including those led by vulnerable populations. With this activity, USAID/Vietnam is supporting Vietnam’s competitiveness: vertically at the policy, market, and firm level; and horizontally by working along the entire spectrum of enterprise growth models, from household businesses transforming into registered firms to small firms on the cusp of scaling up.
IPSC is made up of four interrelated Objectives:
Objective 1. Building business management capacity of SGBs, including those led by vulnerable populations, particularly women and ethnic minorities.
Objective 2. Improving efficiency and productivity by promoting innovation, technology adoption, and sustainable business models.
Objective 3. Enhancing business enabling environment for a broad-based inclusive economy.
Objective 4. Strengthening business-to-business (B2B) and cross-sectoral linkages.
Summary of Activities
IPSC collaborates closely with the Government of Vietnam (GVN) counterparts, including the project owner, AED, under MPI. IPSC and AED develop strategies for sector selection, geographic focus, and SGB engagement and engage a broad range of market actors across the economy that make up the SGB ecosystem, including SGBs, cooperatives, and household businesses (HBs); business chambers, associations, and business development service providers (BDSPs); GVN Ministries and Agencies, provincial and local administrations; and private sector consultants, training institutions, and financial institutions. Using incentives and cost-sharing with SGBs, Pioneering Enterprises (PEs), and other partners, IPSC builds greater demand and supply of business development services (BDS), while improving providers’ capacity to understand and offer services desired in the marketplace.
The MEL Manager will lead the strategic objectives of monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) and collaboration, learning, and adaptation (CLA) activities, while implementing and managing IPSC’s MEL operations across the project.

Oversee the collection, synthesis, and analysis of project data, including updating performance indicator reference sheets (PIRS) and the project Performance Indicator Tracking Table (PITT).
In collaboration with the COP, hold teams accountable for progress against the work plan and project objectives; inputs to reporting requirements, work plan updates, inputs to the AMELP; data collection and aggregation; monitoring progress of technical results; and meeting COP and client requests in a timely fashion.
On a routine basis, identify shifts in the policy and business environment that may impact IPSC directly and provide updates to the technical team.
Build the capacity of IPSC staff to collect required data from activities and input the information into the MEL database to be used to drive decision-making on technical activities.
Engage with project stakeholders to conduct data collection (i.e. informant interviews, focus groups, and surveys) to obtain activity data needed to measure project results.
Implement robust knowledge management and CLA practices across the project, including facilitation of regular strategic review/ pause-and-reflect sessions.
Share best practices with other external audiences, success stories, and generate new ideas for collaboration and learning.
Manage shared online data for internal project use, including uploading reports and materials for access by project staff, and oversee data quality.
Document lessons learned for incorporation into IPSC continuous learning on what works for activity implementation, strategies, and achievement of intended results.
Keep COP appraised of the project’s progress toward objectives and MEL indicators.
Communicate success stories and major milestones achieved to the COP on a regular basis to share with USAID and AED.
