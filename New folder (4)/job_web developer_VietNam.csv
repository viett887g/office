Top 3 reasons to join us
People-first
Teamwork over one's work
Problem Solving Centric
Job description
The position
We’re the team behind projects like BI tool , database diagram tool , and open-source project . We’re looking for another front-end engineer to help us build more awesome tools for data teams and developers.
This is a full-time position based in Ho Chi Minh City with flexible, hybrid WFH/WFO setup.
Our application’s architecture
To get a taste of how working with us is like, here are some insights into how our application has been built so far.
The Holistics app works by allowing data analysts to connect to their data warehouses and develop reusable “data models”. This allows non-technical users to use a friendly drag-and-drop interface to explore the data and build dashboards, without the need to bother their technical colleagues.
On the frontend side, Vue.js 3.0 with TypeScript is our framework of choice for front-end development. To deal with displaying huge amount of data, we build sophisticated, custom Vue components that lazily render the data. Since many complex computation are done on the front-end, we also use Web workers to decouple those computation from the main rendering thread. This enables smoother user experience while also decoupling computation from rendering logic.
Most of our “as-code” features operate in dual modes: code-mode and UI-mode. The code is for technical-savvy users, while the UI mode is for those who prefer a more intuitive start. To support these features, we have developed our own compiler and a web-based editor, similar to a lightweight version of VSCode, both of which are optimized for performance in the browser environment.
On the backend side, Holistics is built using Ruby on Rails as the main web framework. Unlike standard Rails project structure, we modularize the code base into local gems and to improve maintainability and extensibility, following . This also follows the pattern of “ with the gems being mostly functional/stateless code and engines handle the imperative/stateful part of the app.
By using to add static typing on top of Ruby, we ensure that most of our Ruby code has annotated type signature. This not only reduces a whole swath of common bugs that plague Ruby codebases but also significantly improves developer productivity through IDE/editor integrations.
We use PostgreSQL for our main production database due to its reliability and rich feature-set. We have built a , which are then executed using Sidekiq on top of Redis.
What you’ll work on here
Here are some interesting engineering projects that have been going on inside Holistics
Build a web-based IDE for data analysts to explore and develop analytics logic
Build front-end components that can render hundreds of thousand of data points
Build custom, interactive visualization components on top of open source technology
Create a as part of a semantic layer to represent analytics logic
Build a text-based database for analytics metadata on top of Git
Create a that compiles to SQL
Design and build a natural language interface for business users to explore data and view dashboards
The way we work
We follow Spotify squad model. Our team is split into 4 squads, each (5-7 members) consisting of engineers, product managers & designers working closely together.
How we work on a new feature:
Product & Design Team spends time research the problem, talk to customers and prepare Product Discovery Doc (PDD) and Product Requirement Doc (PRD).
Engineering Team then performs a Technical Research. When we have a fairly good picture of the complexity and impact, we’ll start with the implementation.
We do not compromise product and code quality for artificial deadline. We refactor and think about code optimization regularly. We understand the good and bad of technical debt and use them to our advantage.
We employ “pair programming” practices regularly where two team members work on a task together in one workstation. This brings a great deal of benefits, among which are faster knowledge transfer, reduced bus factor, better team cohesion and improved code quality.
We have a strong writing culture: Almost everything is communicated through written documents. Just as our developers write reusable codes, we write .
We maintain a problem-solving culture. Everyone is strongly encouraged to have rigorous understanding of a problem, separating as well as using to find the most important dimensions of a problem. Solutions are deliberated over with trade-offs explicitly listed in discussion documentation. Watch that our cofounder gave (in Vietnamese)
We avoid being a . We’re aware more features do not equal better product.
We let team members rotate every 3-6 months. This allows them to try new things and learn different aspects of the business.
Our culture stimulates continuous learning:
We have a where team members present topics they are interested in.
Engineering Team organizes as well as monthly technical workshops.
Product Team has regular AMA events with external product experts
Your skills and experience
What we look for in you
Here’s our idea of a good team member fit:
You should have a profound interest in the front-end domain. You deeply care about the user experience and building high-performance front-end components.
You should have a strong foundation in Computer Science with good problem-solving ability.
Experience with our technology stack not required: While it’s a bonus, it’s not a requirement for you to be familiar with our current technical stack. We expect you to be able to pick up these quickly on the job.
You should be someone with a continuous learning & growth mindset. You find yourself excited to learn something new as part of the work every week.
Communications: Given we have a strong writing culture, you should be comfortable with communicating your ideas in English written forms.
Genuine interest in the space: We’d love to work with people who are genuinely interested in the product and the space we’re in, someone who cares about the end-product beyond just writing the code that makes it work.
Interview Process
Round 1: Technical interview with the Engineering team (understand your skills and experiences). (Showcase your past front-end projects is highly welcome. We would love to know your approaches to solving UX challenges/performance optimization. Additionally, sharing your codes would be greatly appreciated, as it provides us with a deeper insight into your problem-solving skills and technical prowess.)‍
Round 2: Either System Design interview or takehome assignment (offline - deadline 3 days, will be sent after Round 1)
Round 3: Culture & Behavior Interview

Job Description

We are currently seeking a Drupal Developer to join our dynamic team at Amaris Consulting. This position is an excellent opportunity for those with 1+ years of experience who are looking to take the next step in their career.

Developing custom web applications using Drupal, PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Maintaining existing websites by implementing new features and fixing bugs.

Working closely with project managers and designers to ensure the final product adheres to the predetermined budget, scope, and design.

Analyzing website performance and security data and ensuring necessary updates are implemented regularly.

Maintaining updated knowledge of the development industry and any advancements in technology or trends.

Meeting both technical and consumer needs through collaboration with cross-functional teams on complex projects

This role will provide you with an opportunity to further develop your skills while working alongside our experienced team members on exciting projects.

About You

The ideal candidate for this position should have strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, great organizational skills, and a passion for coding and technical development. Your ability to work independently as part of a team will be crucial for this role.

You have at least 1 year of professional experience developing websites using Drupal CMS; familiarity with other CMS platforms would be advantageous.

You possess solid knowledge of PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Knowledge of SQL databases such as MySQL or PostgreSQL is beneficial too!

Your analytical skills are top-notch, enabling you to troubleshoot and solve problems as they arise.

Your communication skills are excellent, allowing for effective collaboration with team members across different departments.

Experience working in an Agile or Scrum development process would be beneficial but not essential.

If you're looking for a challenging role where you can apply your existing knowledge and experience while also developing new skills, this could be the perfect opportunity for you!

What can you expect?

Amaris Consulting is proud to be an equal-opportunity workplace. We are committed to promoting diversity within the workforce and creating an inclusive working environment. For this purpose, we welcome applications from all qualified candidates, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, beliefs, age, marital status, disability, or other characteristics.

Who are we?
Amaris Consulting is an independent technology consulting firm providing guidance and solutions to businesses. With more than 1000 clients across the globe, we have been rolling out solutions in major projects for over a decade – this is made possible by an international team of 7500 people spread across 5 continents and more than 60 countries. Our solutions focus on four different Business Lines: Information System & Digital, Telecom, Life Sciences and Engineering. We’re focused on building and nurturing a top talent community where all our team members can achieve their full potential. Amaris is your steppingstone to cross rivers of change, meet challenges and achieve all your projects with success.

At Amaris, we strive to provide our candidates with the best possible recruitment experience. We like to get to know our candidates, challenge them, and be able to give them proper feedback as quickly as possible. Here's what our recruitment process looks like:

Brief Call: Our process typically begins with a brief virtual/phone conversation to get to know you! The objective? Learn about you, understand your motivations, and make sure we have the right job for you!

Interviews (the average number of interviews is 3 - the number may vary depending on the level of seniority required for the position). During the interviews, you will meet people from our team: your line manager of course, but also other people related to your future role. We will talk in depth about you, your experience, and skills, but also about the position and what will be expected of you. Of course, you will also get to know Amaris: our culture, our roots, our teams, and your career opportunities!

Case study: Depending on the position, we may ask you to take a test. This could be a role play, a technical assessment, a problem-solving scenario, etc.

As you know, every person is different and so is every role in a company. That is why we have to adapt accordingly, and the process may differ slightly at times. However, please know that we always put ourselves in the candidate's shoes to ensure they have the best possible experience.
We look forward to meeting you!"

Actively participate in code reviews, provide constructive feedback, and adhere to coding best practices to maintain high code quality.
Create and maintain technical documentation for mobile applications and SDKs to facilitate efficient development and future maintenance.
Stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the Android and iOS ecosystems, ensuring that our apps and SDKs leverage the latest features and optimizations.
Collaborate with Scrum Masters, Design Teams, and Planning Teams to align development efforts with project goals and timelines.
Proactively identify areas for improvement in development processes, tools, and technologies, and implement enhancements to increase efficiency and quality.

The core function of this role is to design, implement, and support a range of headless services across a multi-tiered platform. The recruit will be assigned a mentor and a specific range of services, both mentors and services may change over time or on demand.
Our software stack is primarily Microsoft .net/.netcore and SQLServer supplemented by open-source technologies. We deploy across private and public cloud providers (primarily Azure), with a laaS and PaaS models hybrid. The platform contains both synchronous/asynchronous services using SOA. A large portion of core business logic is maintained within SQLServer (strong tSQL is desirable but not essential for all roles).
Currently, the platform is in a large evolution cycle from legacy Windows services, web services and apps to modern containerized and cloud-ready equivalents, running within Swarm and more recently Kubernetes. This evolution work is both exciting and challenging, requiring us to re-evaluate our CI/CD delivery pipelines and tooling to support the same. This work is ongoing and includes many cloud-native technologies such as Kafka, Prometheus, Grafana, Fluentd/bit, HAProxy, Kubernetes as a Service, etc .. The goal is to transform our entire platform to a more cost-effective cloud solution whilst redesigning/porting components and solutions to take advantage of cloud-native technologies.
The software delivery pipeline is sprint/scrum-based, with multiple concurrent sprints covering various product/client verticals. Our sprints are typically three-week cycles with many daily builds. These delivery pipelines are also undergoing evolution with CD to Production and vertical team independence as the ultimate goal.
CORE RESPONSIBILITIES
Work with other members of Engineering to design/document/develop holistic solutions to be delivered across our sprint delivery model. Large feature/function is typically delivered in fragments awaiting its final assembly, configuration and enabling in Production
Provide accurate estimates for the assigned feature/function implementation and deliver to those estimates (within the sprint). Attend daily scrum to inform progress/blockers on assignments.
Implement assigned aspects (formal specification) of the agreed solution within a Test-Driven Development approach. Take pro-active steps to ensure high availability/reliability and high performance/through-put of solutions. All coding is performed directly on the trunk (on SVN repository) and within strict guidelines. All service configurations are managed within a well-defined configuration management process catering for multiple environments and service instances.
Assist in the maintenance, tuning (/performance optimization) and issue resolution of production services
Assist in the definition and implementation of development best practice, environment maintenance and tool selection. As well as assisting in the evaluation and recommendation of new technologies, platforms, and software.
Work with 3rd party service providers and integrations as/when the need arises.

Our team is composed of Vietnamese/Thai and foreign nationals (> 8 nationalities). So you will have the opportunity to lead developers coming from various backgrounds, cultures, and countries.
There is a lot of room for you to learn and grow in this role. We are open to new initiatives and processes to improve the way we operate.
Why You'll Love Working Here
You will be proud of any product that has our name on it.
We are an engineering-driven company. Both co-founders are software engineers and led the tech teams at the most prominent e-commerce powerhouses in South East Asia.
We really pay attention and care about processes, high quality, and aesthetics.
Strong processes. We not only believe but also really work following agile principles. Developers work on well-sized and well-defined user stories, do estimate using points and work iteratively in short sprints (1-2 weeks).
We have regular one-on-one reviews to constantly improve and grow. We have a clearly defined process for our developers to level up continuously not only their technical skills but also soft skills.
Our vast amount of learning resources (Pluralsight, Pragpub, Leanpub, e-books, etc.) and yearly education allowance to step up your game.
Private medical insurance from day one.
M1 MacBook, large screens, and any accessory to let you work comfortably.
Casual work attire for everyone.
Comfortable and modern office space environment in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang.
Our office kitchen is fully stocked with drinks and snacks for the team.
26 days of paid leaves/year (11 public holidays + 15 personal days).
Sabbatical month every 3 years.
Company outing every year.
And many more perks!
5 years or more of professional web development experience. Experience in Ruby, Elixir, JavaScript (Node.JS) or Go is preferred.
Prior experience as Engineering Lead/Engineering Manager/Tech Lead for teams of 5 or more is required.
Prior experience in hiring software developers is required.
Current active software development experience. We are looking for engineering leaders who are still involved in development actively and want to continue doing so.
Enjoy working on challenging solutions and systems.
Believe that building great applications is not only about delivering code that “works”, but involves thinking about reusability, maintainability, security, and performance.
A ""Can do attitude"" and a product mindset.
Confidence in communicating in English."

Top 3 reasons to join us
People-first
Teamwork over one's work
Problem Solving Centric
Job description
We’re the team behind projects like BI tool Holistics [1], database diagram tool dbdiagram.io [2], and open-source project dbml.org [3]. We’re looking for another software engineer to help us build more awesome tools for data teams and developers.
This is a full-time position based in Ho Chi Minh City with flexible, hybrid WFH/WFO setup.
Our application’s architecture
To get a taste of how working with us is like, here are some insights into how our application has been built so far.
The Holistics app works by allowing data analysts to connect to their data warehouses and develop reusable “data models”. This allows non-technical users to use a friendly drag-and-drop interface to explore the data and build dashboards, without the need to bother their technical colleagues.
On the backend side, Holistics is built using Ruby on Rails as the main web framework. Unlike standard Rails project structure, we modularize the code base into local gems and engines [4] to improve maintainability and extensibility, following modular monolith pattern [5]. This also follows the pattern of “Functional core, imperative shell"" [6] with the gems being mostly functional/stateless code and engines handling the imperative/stateful part of the app.
By using Sorbet [7] to add static typing on top of Ruby, we ensure that most of our Ruby code has annotated type signature. This not only reduces a whole swath of common bugs that plagues Ruby codebases but also significantly improves developer productivity through IDE/editor integrations.
We use PostgreSQL for our main production database due to its reliability and rich feature-set. We have built a custom job queue system on top of Postgres [8], which are then executed using Sidekiq on top of Redis.
Vue.js 3.0 with TypeScript is our framework of choice for front-end development. To deal with displaying huge amounts of data, we build sophisticated, custom Vue components that lazily render the data. Since many complex computations are done on the front-end, we also use Web workers to decouple those computations from the main rendering thread. This enables a smoother user experience while also decoupling computation from rendering logic.

What you’ll work on here
Here are some interesting engineering projects that have been going on inside Holistics
Create a new query language that compiles to SQL
Build front-end component that can render hundreds of thousands of data points
Build custom, interactive visualization components on top of open source technology
Create a domain specific language as part of a semantic layer to represent analytics logic
Build a text-based database for analytics metadata on top of Git
Build a web-based IDE for data analysts to explore and develop analytics logic
Design and build a natural language interface for business users to explore data and view dashboards
‍
The way we work
We follow Spotify squad model. Our team is split into 4 squads, each (5-7 members) consisting of engineers, product managers & designers working closely together.
How we work on a new feature:
Product & Design Team spends time researching the problem, talking to customers and prepare Product Discovery Doc (PDD) and Product Requirement Doc (PRD).
Engineering Team then performs a Technical Research. When we have a fairly good picture of the complexity and impact, we’ll start with the implementation.
We avoid being a feature factory [9]. We’re aware more features do not equal better product.
We do not compromise product and code quality for artificial deadlines. We refactor and think about code optimization regularly. We understand the good and bad of technical debt and use them to our advantage.
We employ “pair programming” practices regularly where two team members work on a task together in one workstation. This brings a great deal of benefits, among which are faster knowledge transfer, reduced bus factor, better team cohesion, and improved code quality.
We have a strong writing culture: Almost everything is communicated through written documents. Just as our developers write reusable codes, we write evergreen notes [10].
We maintain a problem-solving culture. Everyone is strongly encouraged to have rigorous understanding of a problem, separating Problem Space vs Solution Space [11] as well as using Eigenquestions [12] to find the most important dimensions of a problem. Solutions are deliberated over with trade-offs explicitly listed in discussion documentation. Watch this talk about problem-solving for engineers [13] that our cofounder gave (in Vietnamese)

Our culture stimulates continuous learning:
We let team members rotate every 3-6 months. This allows them to try new things and learn different aspects of the business.
Our culture stimulates continuous learning:
We have a weekly TED talk program [14] where team members present topics they are interested in.
Engineering Team organizes weekly technical talks [15] as well as monthly technical workshops.
Product Team has regular AMA events with external product experts
Your skills and experience
What we look for in you
Here’s our idea of a good team member fit:
You should have a strong foundation in Computer Science with good problem-solving ability.
Experience with our technology stack not required: While it’s a bonus, it’s not a requirement for you to be familiar with our current technical stack. We expect you to be able to pick up these quickly on the job.
You should be someone with a continuous learning & growth mindset. You find yourself excited to learn something new as part of the work every week.
Communications: Given we have a strong writing culture, you should be comfortable with communicating your ideas in English written forms.
Genuine interest in the space: We’d love to work with people who are genuinely interested in the product and the space we’re in, someone who cares about the end-product beyond just writing the code that makes it work.

Interview Process
Round 1: Technical interview with the Engineering team (understand your skills and experiences)
Round 2: Either System Design interview or takehome assignment (offline - deadline 3 days, will be sent after Round 2)
Round 3: Culture & Behavior Interview
Why you'll love working here

Weekly TED talks to expand skills and knowledge.
Yearly budget to support personal and professional growth, well-beings and interest cultivations.

At Amaris, we strive to provide our candidates with the best possible recruitment experience. We like to get to know our candidates, challenge them, and be able to give them proper feedback as quickly as possible. Here's what our recruitment process looks like:

Brief Call: Our process typically begins with a brief virtual/phone conversation to get to know you! The objective? Learn about you, understand your motivations, and make sure we have the right job for you!

Interviews (the average number of interviews is 3 - the number may vary depending on the level of seniority required for the position). During the interviews, you will meet people from our team: your line manager of course, but also other people related to your future role. We will talk in depth about you, your experience, and skills, but also about the position and what will be expected of you. Of course, you will also get to know Amaris: our culture, our roots, our teams, and your career opportunities!

Case study: Depending on the position, we may ask you to take a test. This could be a role play, a technical assessment, a problem-solving scenario, etc.

As you know, every person is different and so is every role in a company. That is why we have to adapt accordingly, and the process may differ slightly at times. However, please know that we always put ourselves in the candidate's shoes to ensure they have the best possible experience.
We look forward to meeting you!"
